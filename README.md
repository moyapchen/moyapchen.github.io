# Hello There!

[Website link](https://moyapchen.github.io)

This is my personal above-the-fold web page, using the [Poole Jekyll](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) theme, with some [Tufte-style footnotes](https://github.com/clayh53/tufte-jekyll/blob/master/_plugins/sidenote.rb) cause I have a hard time not adding in something a little wonky :)

## Notes
Stuff I want to change:
* Add in the footnotes :D
* Make it so that there's not quite so much whitepsace if the page is large enough for it..
