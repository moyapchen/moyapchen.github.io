# Hello There!

[Website link](https://moyapchen.github.io)

This is my personal above-the-fold web page, using the [Poole Jekyll](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) theme, with some [Tufte-style footnotes](https://github.com/clayh53/tufte-jekyll/blob/master/_plugins/sidenote.rb) cause I have a hard time not adding in something a little wonky :)

## Notes
Stuff I want to change:
* Add in a way for things to not be blog posts but still have tags? Hmmmmmm.... 
   * Want to do a thing a la gwern where there's pages for specific topics
* Make the home page not just be a bunch of posts, but maybe summaries thereof? 

Stuff changed:
* Add in footnotes :D
* Add in emojis 

Gotchas:
* Can't install any plugins not in https://pages.github.com/versions/ :(
