Hi there. My name is Moya.

## The Job Stuff

I'm currently a research engineer at Meta AI Research, based in NYC. 

I get paid to dork around with AI/ML, large language models, chatbots, and NLP. It's pretty great. 

Before that, I was on a computer vision team doing large scale localization, a different computer vision team doing face filters (among a bunch of other things), and a spam team. 
Before joining Facebook (and the corporate world as a whole), I did my undergrad at Caltech. [^mole]  

[^mole]: gdbg, ttboai :)

## The This (Site) Stuff

Spun this up in about a day with github pages using the [Poole Jekyll](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) template, with some minor modifications to fit me. 

If you want to see the underlying code + commit history, it's at
