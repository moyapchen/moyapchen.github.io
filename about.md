Hi there. My name is Moya.

Some quotes I've liked for decades now: 

<div class="message" style="text-align: center;">
  "Dream in a pragmatic way" ~ Aldous Huxley 
</div>

<div class="message" style="text-align: center;">
"I urge you to please notice when you are happy, and exclaim or murmur or think at some point, 'If this isn't nice, I don't know what is.‚Äù ~ Kurt Vonnegut Jr
</div>

<div class="message" style="text-align: center;">
"We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be." ~ Vonnegut (again)
</div>



## The Job Stuff

I'm currently a research engineer at Meta AI Research, based in NYC. 

I get paid to dork around with AI/ML, large language models, chatbots, and NLP. It's pretty great. 

Before that, I was on a computer vision team doing large scale localization, a different computer vision team doing face filters (among a bunch of other things), and a spam team working on abuse of political ads abuse and API abuse in general. 

Before joining Facebook (and the corporate world as a whole), I did my undergrad at Caltech. [^mole]  

[^mole]: A Mole (gdbg, ttboai) if you must know. :hugs:	  

## The Life Stuff

I spend a lot of time doing everything and nothing.

I genuinely enjoy tech and have since I was a kid, so a good amount of time is spent dorking around reading tech journalism, especially going ons between tech and policy/society/business/etc. I have a pretty rigorous computer science background and have had some pretty unique experiences while being on the inside of That One Social Media Beast, so it can be quite interesting to compare and contrast what I've experienced first-hand. 

Laundry list of other things I do:
* Outdoors-y fitness-y things: Hiking, climbing, backpacking
   * Training for long distance races in foreign countries (Cuba, maybe Istanbul?)
* Piano (good), flute (good high school level), guitar + ukulele (better-than-total-beginner)
* Reading 
   * Mostly non-fiction, occasionally good sci-fi, though sourcing that is hard
* Random classes I've taken: 
   * Improv, Woodworking


I also hope to do more writing, which is the purpose of the existence of this site. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:	  

## The This (Site) Stuff

Spun this up in about a day with github pages using the [Poole Jekyll](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) template, with some minor modifications (mostly CSS) to fit me. [Click here](https://github.com/moyapchen/moyapchen.github.io) for the underlying repo.
