Hi there. My name is Moya.

Some quotes I've liked for decades now: 

<div class="message" style="text-align: center;">
  "Dream in a pragmatic way" ~ Aldous Huxley 
</div>

<div class="message" style="text-align: center;">
"I urge you to please notice when you are happy, and exclaim or murmur or think at some point, 'If this isn't nice, I don't know what is.” ~ Kurt Vonnegut Jr
</div>

<div class="message" style="text-align: center;">
"We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be." ~ Vonnegut[^vonnegut]
</div>

[^vonnegut]: My literary tastes as a high schooler could be (somewhat) summed up as "required books for school, plus a bunch of things by snarky old white dudes". I did read through quite a bit of extra Vonnegut in college, thanks to the old sci fi library in the Caltech SAC basement.

"The opposite of war is not peace - it's creation!" ~ Jonathan Larson (Rent)

## The Job Stuff

I'm currently a research engineer at Meta AI Research, based in NYC. 

I get paid to dork around with AI/ML, large language models, chatbots, and NLP. It's pretty great. 

Before that, I was on a computer vision team doing large scale localization, a different computer vision team doing face filters (among a bunch of other things), and a spam team working on political ads abuse as well as API abuse in general. 

Before joining Facebook (and the corporate world as a whole), I did my undergrad at Caltech. [^mole]  

[^mole]: A Mole (gdbg, ttboai) if you must know. :hugs:	  

## The Life Stuff

I spend a lot of time doing everything and nothing.

I genuinely enjoy tech and have since I was a kid, so a good amount of time is spent dorking around reading tech journalism, especially going ons between tech and policy/society/business/etc. I have a pretty rigorous computer science background and have had some pretty unique experiences while being on the inside of That One Social Media Beast, so it can be quite interesting to compare what's being said outside versus what I've experienced first-hand. 

### Laundry list of other things I do
* Outdoors-y fitness-y things: Hiking, climbing, backpacking
   * Training for long distance races in foreign countries (Cuba, maybe Istanbul?)
* Piano (good), flute (good high school level), guitar + ukulele (better-than-total-beginner)
* Reading 
   * Mostly non-fiction, occasionally good sci-fi, though sourcing that is hard
* Random classes I've taken: 
   * Improv, Woodworking


I also hope to do more writing, which is the purpose of the existence of this site. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:	  

## The This (Site) Stuff

Spun this up in about a day with github pages using the [Poole Jekyll](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) template, with some minor modifications (mostly CSS, also footnotes + emojis) to fit me. [Click here](https://github.com/moyapchen/moyapchen.github.io) for the underlying repo.

The image in the sidebar is a photo of some fireworks that I took as a high schooler, back when I had a bit of a photography phase. I had a shoddy digital camera but figured out how to play with the exposure time; I was plesantly surprised when one of my random "let's shoot at a firework while shaking the camera" images looked vaguely like something else.

[^flickr]: Incidentally, I wonder if being a Flickr user first is why I ended up getting into Instagram relatively late in the curve of things [^sister] — I'd already satisfied my picture sharing urges with Flickr, and was never quite bought into the lead-by-aesthetics of Instagram. (Though, I definitely appreciate its value!)

[^sister]: ...and only as a result of it being the primary way to contact my little sister... God I hate the messaging app ecosystem fragmentation that exists in the US right now. [^infinite_jest]

[^infinite_jest]: Incidentally, despite this unnecessary (and slightly over-the-top) usage of footnotes, I've never actually finished *Infinite Jest*.
