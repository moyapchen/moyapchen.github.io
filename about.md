Hi there. My name is Moya.

## Some Quotes I've Liked for Decades Now 

<div class="message" style="text-align: center;">
  "Dream in a pragmatic way"
<br>- Aldous Huxley 
</div>

<div class="message" style="text-align: center;">
"I urge you to please notice when you are happy, and exclaim or murmur or think at some point, 'If this isn't nice, I don't know what is.'”
<br>- Kurt Vonnegut Jr [^vonnegut]
</div>

<div class="message" style="text-align: center;">
"We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be."
<br>- Kurt Vonnegut Jr (Mother Night) [^vonnegut]
</div>

[^vonnegut]: My literary tastes as a high schooler is somewhat summed up as "required books for school, plus 'classics', plus a bunch of things by snarky old white dudes". I already liked Vonnegut then ("snarky old white dudes") but also had some solid opportunities to read more of his things in college, thanks to the old sci fi library in the Caltech SAC basement. I could also maybe include about a half-dozen Dune quotes, but those can be weird without context; Frank Herbert's writing style also leaves some... things to be desired. 
 
<div class="message" style="text-align: center;">
"The opposite of war is not peace - it's creation!"
<br>- Jonathan Larson (Rent)

## The Job Stuff

After failing to get laid off 3 times[^layoff], I voluntarily quit in July 2023. If you're curious about why, see [this copy of the Motiviations part from my quit post]({% post_url 2023-07-07-badge_post-2-motivations %}).

[^layoff]: 32 weeks (16 base + 2 x 8 years of service) of severance would've been great. Some folks ask why I didn't sandbag myself to get the $$ - turns out, I've got too much of a conscience and feel enough guilt for my coworkers (not to mention anxiousness over my own unproductivity) to go that long.

I've got a project that I'm working on. Ask me about it in person. Might be a big swing and a miss, but [gonna go for the swing anyhow](https://kiwisbybeat.net/minus/part-37). 

Prior to that, I spent a smudge over eight years walking the research-to-production pipeline but backwards at Facebook. Lot of this is in [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/moyachen/) but I semi-refuse to take that site wholly seriously, so here you go.

Separating out the LLM stuff cause that's the stuff that's <i>oh so hot</i> right now. 

* Research engineer, FAIR + GenAI. <i>(Nov 2022-Jul 2023)</i>
    * Large language model pretraining. Mostly looking at pretraining data. Nomadic-ish. 
    * [Llama 2](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/llama-2-open-foundation-and-fine-tuned-chat-models/) 
* Research engineer, FAIR (Facebook AI Research). <i>(Sept 2020-Oct 2022)</i>
    * Dorked around with [chatbots](https://about.fb.com/news/2022/08/blenderbot-ai-chatbot-improves-through-conversation/), [reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07919), and other parts of natural language processing. Was part of the [oncall for the OPT-175B train](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01068). NYC.

Before that, I worked in applied research computer vision on large scale AR localization, face filters, and computational photography; before that, I was on a spam team working on political ads abuse + API abuse in general. This was all in the Seattle office. See [this old CV from June 2022](/public/mpchen_industry_cv___June_2020__From_academic_cv_nov_2019_.pdf) for more of the details there. 

Before joining Facebook (and the corporate world as a whole), I did my undergrad at Caltech. [^mole][^mit] 

[^mole]: A Mole (gdbg, ttboai) if you must know. :hugs:	  
[^mit]: Someday I'll write a blog post about turning down MIT[^yup] and the obnoxious-but-unavoidable credentials-based reputation signalling that happens in high-risk, low-information scenarios. 
[^yup]: Yup, got into both MIT + Caltech, and decided to turn down MIT cause the folks I happened to know there felt too normal. High schoolers be silly, lol. :upside_down_face: 

## The Life Stuff

I spend a lot of time doing everything and nothing.

I genuinely enjoy tech and have since I was a kid, so a good amount of time is spent dorking around reading tech journalism, especially going ons between tech and policy/society/business/etc and comparing/contrasting it with what I've experienced first-hand. 

### Laundry list of other things I do
* Outdoors-y fitness-y things: Hiking, climbing, backpacking
   * Distance racing: Havana marathon 2017, Istanbul marathon 2022
* Music: Piano (good), flute (good high school level), guitar + ukulele (better-than-total-beginner)
* Reading 
   * Mostly non-fiction, occasionally good sci-fi (<3 Ted Chiang)
* Random classes I've taken: 
   * Improv, Musical Improv, Woodworking
   * Wilderness First Responder (cert + recert)  
   * Scuba Diving (Advanced Open Water; will get this to Rescue Diver at some point) 


I also hope to do more writing, which is the purpose of the existence of this site. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:	  

### Friends 

Places that let me hobo:

## The This (Site) Stuff

Spun this up in about a day with github pages using the [Poole Jekyll](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) template, with some minor modifications (mostly CSS, also footnotes + emojis) to fit me. [Click here](https://github.com/moyapchen/moyapchen.github.io) for the underlying repo.

The image in the sidebar is a photo of some fireworks that I took as a high schooler, back when I had a bit of a photography phase. I had a shoddy digital camera but figured out how to play with the exposure time; I was plesantly surprised when one of my random "let's shoot at a firework while shaking the camera" images looked vaguely like it could be a bird. [Link to original (on Flickr) here.](https://www.flickr.com/photos/randomnormality/2638292064/) [^flickr]

Also I'm mostly definitely not a graphic designer. Plz halp. (See contact info below.)  

[^flickr]: Incidentally, I wonder if being a Flickr user first is why I ended up getting into Instagram relatively late in the curve of things [^sister] — I'd already satisfied my picture sharing urges with Flickr, and was never quite bought into the lead-by-aesthetics of Instagram. (Though, I definitely appreciate its value!)

[^sister]: ...and only as a result of it being the primary way to contact my little sister... God I hate the messaging app ecosystem fragmentation that exists right now. [^infinite_jest]

[^infinite_jest]: Incidentally, despite this unnecessary (and slightly over-the-top) usage of footnotes, I've never actually finished *Infinite Jest*.
